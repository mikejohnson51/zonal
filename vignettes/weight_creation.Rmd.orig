## Methods 

The first step in computing zonal statistics are the need to compute a weight map that can be used to reallocate the gridded data with respect to the percent overlapping each cell. There are two primary packages that tackle this which include `intersectr` (which uses `areal` as a back-end) and `zonal` which uses `exactextractr`. 

### Option 1: Intersectr: 

Setting up the data for a `intersectr` weights map requires (1) computing a vector representation of the grid and (2) intersecting the aggregation units with this grid to determine the percent overlap or "coverage fraction". Below the workflow from the `intersectr` docs is wrapped in a function that requires a NetCDF file path, a `sf` geometry set, an ID variable in the geometries and the variable to extract from the grid.

```{r}
library(intersectr)
library(ncmeta)
library(RNetCDF)

intersectr_weights = function(file, geom, ID, var ){
  nc_coord_vars <- nc_coord_var(file)
  variable_name <- var
  nc_coord_vars <- filter(nc_coord_vars, variable == variable_name)
  
  nc       <- open.nc(file)
  X_coords <- var.get.nc(nc, nc_coord_vars$X, unpack = TRUE)
  Y_coords <- var.get.nc(nc, nc_coord_vars$Y, unpack = TRUE)
  
  nc_prj <- nc_gm_to_prj(nc_grid_mapping_atts(file))
    
  cell_geometry = create_cell_geometry(X_coords = X_coords,
                         Y_coords = Y_coords,
                         prj = nc_prj,
                         geom = geom, 
                         buffer_dist = 0.1, # Degrees
                         regularize = TRUE)
    
  data_source_cells <- st_sf(dplyr::select(cell_geometry, grid_ids))
  target_polygons   <- st_sf(dplyr::select(geom, !!ID))
  st_agr(data_source_cells) <- "constant"
  st_agr(target_polygons)   <- "constant"
    
  calculate_area_intersection_weights(
      data_source_cells,
      target_polygons, allow_lonlat = TRUE)
}

```

### Option 2: Zonal

In `zonal` grid weights are calcuated using `exactextractr` as the backend. The key function needed in `weighting_grid`.

## Use Cases

Here two motivating use cases are shown to compare the efficiency of these two approaches. The first covers a large area but has many small aggregation units. The second also covers a large area but has a few large polygon agggreation units. Each of these poses a unique set of demands with repect to how 


### Many small aggregation units

Here, we look at an example with ~20,000 watersheds along the east coast.

```{r}
file <-  '/Users/mjohnson/Downloads/pet_1979.nc'

geom <- st_make_valid(read_sf('/Users/mjohnson/github/hydrofabric/workflow/nhd_workflows/cache/ngen_01a-4.gpkg', "catchments"))
```

The gridded data and aggregate units we are working with can be seen below:

```{r data-grid}
(meta = nc_dims(file))
```

The grid we are working with holds daily PET values for CONUS for the year 1979. It has:

- `r prettyNum(filter(meta, name == 'lon')$length, big.mark = ",")` X_cells
- `r prettyNum(filter(meta, name == 'lat')$length, big.mark = ",")` Y_cells 
- `r prettyNum(filter(meta, name == 'day')$length, big.mark = ",")` time slices 

for a total of `r prettyNum(prod(meta$length), big.mark = ",")` values.

```{r data-geom}
glimpse(geom)
```
  
In total we have `r prettyNum(nrow(geom), big.mark = ",")` aggregation units to summarize over the `r filter(meta, name == 'day')$length` time steps.


```{r}
bnch <- bench::mark(
  iterations = 1, check = FALSE, time_unit = "s",
  intersectr = intersectr_weights(file, geom, "comid", "potential_evapotranspiration"),
  zonal      = zonal::weighting_grid(file, geom, "comid"),
)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bnch %>%
  dplyr::select(expression, median, mem_alloc) %>%
  mutate(expression = names(expression),
         median_rel = unclass(median/min(median)),
         mem_rel = unclass(mem_alloc/min(mem_alloc))) %>% 
  formattable::formattable()
```


### A few large aggregation units

Here, we test aggregation the 4km gridded data to 64 counties in Colorado.

```{r}
colorado  = AOI::aoi_get(state = "CO", county = "all")
glimpse(colorado)
```
  
In total we have `r prettyNum(nrow(colorado), big.mark = ",")` aggregation units to summarize over the `r filter(meta, name == 'day')$length` time steps.


```{r}
bnch2 <- bench::mark(
  iterations = 1, check = FALSE, time_unit = "s",
  intersectr = intersectr_weights(file, colorado, "name", "potential_evapotranspiration"),
  zonal      = zonal::weighting_grid(file, colorado, "name")
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bnch2 %>%
  dplyr::select(expression, median, mem_alloc) %>%
  mutate(expression = names(expression),
         median_rel = unclass(median/min(median)),
         mem_rel = unclass(mem_alloc/min(mem_alloc))) %>% 
  formattable::formattable()
```

Notably the `intersectr` approach, based on vector intersections, is unable to scale well when the aggregation units are large.

## What is a weight grid? 

A weight grid is unique to the aggregate units and grid its build from. It contains columns documenting the X and Y indexes of each grid cell along with the grid id. The X,Y are realtive to the entire grid, while the grid ID is relative to subsetwithin the bounding domain of the aggregations unit(s). Additionally the `w` stores the percent overlap between the grid cell and the aggregation unit identified by the ID column which is speified in the `build`weighting_grid` function. An example is shown below:

```{r}
zonal      = zonal::weighting_grid(file, colorado, "name")
head(zonal)
```
